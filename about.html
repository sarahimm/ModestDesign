              <p>Modest Design is a framework for creating actively unmanipulative software--digital experiences which give the user as much agency as possible. It's a design pattern with a <b>bias toward restraint</b>: Modest apps don't want to take up more of their users' time and attention than is absolutely necessary to complete a task.</p>
              <p>Modest Design isn't necessarily minimalist. However, every design element must be intentional and well-suited to the importance of the task the user is completing. Because we're working in an industry full of subtly manipulative and addictive software, we need to make sure that we aren't just throwing design elements onto the page and hoping they'll have a neutral or positive effect.</p>
              <p>The most important factors to bear in mind when evaluating software with Modest Design are <b>immersion</b> and <b>agency</b> (more on this under 'Sources'). We want to maximize user agency, putting them in control of their experience as much as possible, while limiting immersion to the minimum level of focus needed for the purpose of the app or site. So your productivity app probably shouldn't have a minigame, and it shouldn't feel entitled to any more of the user's time or attention than the user willingly bestows on it.</p>

            <div class="about-content">
                <p><b>The software we use every day is bad for us, and UX is a large part of the problem.</b> A <a href="https://www.reviews.org/mobile/cell-phone-addiction/." target="_blank">2022 poll</a> indicates that 47% of Americans consider themselves addicted to their cell phones. Use of digital devices has been linked to eye strain, insomnia, anxiety, depression, lack of focus, and decreased attention spans.</p>
                <p>UX researchers have done a lot of work to identify the causes of these effects. The <a href="https://darkpatterns.uxp2.com/" target="_blank">UXP2 Lab</a> lists five major types of deceptive "dark patterns" in UX, while Harry Brignull, who coined the term, identifies <a href="https://deceptive.design/types" target="_blank">16 types of deceptive design</a> and even maintains a <a href="https://www.deceptive.design/hall-of-shame" target="_blank">"hall of shame"</a> for the most flagrant abuses. Similarly, Chris Nodder writes about the <a href="https://evilbydesign.info/" target="_blank">"Seven Deadly Sins" of interaction design.</a> In short, we know it's a problem, and we're always finding new and inventive abuses of UX design.</p>
                <p>Itentifying the problem is an important first step, but our growing lists of design patterns to avoid isn't going to help us design for our users' well-being so long as what constitutes "good design" is decided by for-profit companies who just want to keep their users' eyes glued to their screens.</p>
                <p>That's where Modest Design comes in. It is an attempt to provide a positive list of qualities for mindful UX design so that we can set a new standard for design that doesn't impose on its users.</p>

                <p>More than anything, this website is meant to start a conversation.</p>
                <p>Good design tends to go unnoticed, because it doesn't draw attention to itself--this is doubly true for Modest Design. This site is a place to identify, admire, and emulate software interfaces which do exactly what they're meant to do, nothing more. So, please, if you have an example of Modest Design you've encountered out in the wild, share it in the forum.</p>
                <p>And if you disagree about what Modest Design is or should be, share that, too! Finding better ways to talk about healthier software design will require input from within the industry and outside it, from everyone involved with these applications--from their design, to their deployment, to their everyday use. </p>
                <p>These principles aren't backed by research or user testimonies--yet. One of the biggest ways you can advance these principles is by trying them out and seeing what happens. Consider using these principles to create modest versions of all the apps that tend to keep you glued to the screen and report back on whether it changes your screen time. Use the checklist to evaluate your current project and see if it corresponds with user feedback. Go a month only using apps you consider to be modest and see how it affects your mental health. Put these ideas to the test! Then, whatever the result, come back here and talk about it.</p>

                <h4>Isn't all design manipulative?</h4>
                <p>If you want to be cynical about it, maybe. But there are lots of examples of design affecting people in positive ways. If you've ever sat in an office with lots of natural lighting, or taken in the calming art prints and color palettes of a therapist's office, or listened to a playlist of music curated for focus, your mood and thoughts have been influenced by design. Should we write all that off as "manipulative?" </p>

                <p>All design influences its users--that's a fundamental principle in UX. But this project is based in the notion that not all influence needs to be manipulative. Influencing each other is just what humans do, and influence on its own is not necessarily a bad thing.</p>

                <p>So where is the line between influence and manipulation?There are a lot of different answers out there, but for our purposes we'll say that <b>influence becomes manipulation when its effectiveness depends on  limiting the agency and/or awareness of the person being influenced.</b></p>
                
                <h4>Are these just arbitrary principles?</h4>
                
                <p>Yes, to an extent. There's no definitive metric for defining the goodness of a piece of software, and there's no scientific research to show that the sixteen principles presented here are the most important qualities for mindful software design.</p>

                <p>However, this set of principles was chosen thoughtfully so that it could cover as many of the pitfalls that lead to manipulative design practices as possible. At the same time, they need to be clear, organized, and useful categories in order to help us talk more directly about the rather abstract idea of mindful software.</p>

                <p>Each principle combines one thing which software <i>does</i> (an affordance) with one thing it <i>should be</i>  (a virtue). The result is a sort of ideal quality we can use to talk about *how* the software affects its users ("This app is spatially imbalanced," for instance, or "the participatory features of this website aren't very accessible"). The affordances are pulled from the work of Janet Murray, a digital media scholar (see 'Sources'), while the virtues were carefully chosen as part of this project. They aren't meant to be definitive; they're meant to be a helpful tool for designers and a way to spark conversation in the UX industry about what makes software good for its users. </p>
                
                <p>If you have strong opinions on the qualities I've selected for this list, and if you'd care to do some conversation-starting of your own, consider <a href="/forum">creating a discussion thread </a> here.</p>
